/// Constructs a new SIMD vector by copying elements from selected lanes in other vectors.
///
/// When swizzling one vector, lanes are selected by a `const` array of `usize`,
/// like [`Swizzle`].
///
/// When swizzling two vectors, lanes are selected by a `const` array of [`Which`],
/// like [`Swizzle2`].
///
/// # Examples
///
/// With a single SIMD vector, the const array specifies lane indices in that vector:
/// ```
/// # #![feature(portable_simd)]
/// # use core::simd::{u32x2, u32x4, simd_swizzle};
/// let v = u32x4::from_array([10, 11, 12, 13]);
///
/// // Keeping the same size
/// let r: u32x4 = simd_swizzle!(v, [3, 0, 1, 2]);
/// assert_eq!(r.to_array(), [13, 10, 11, 12]);
///
/// // Changing the number of lanes
/// let r: u32x2 = simd_swizzle!(v, [3, 1]);
/// assert_eq!(r.to_array(), [13, 11]);
/// ```
