# Beginner's Guide To SIMD

Hello and welcome to our SIMD basics guide!

Because SIMD is a subject that many programmers haven't worked with before, we thought that it's best to outline some terms and other basics for you to get started with.

## Quick Background

**SIMD** stands for *Single Instruction, Multiple Data*. In other words, SIMD is when the CPU performs a single action on more than one logical piece of data at the same time. Instead of adding two registers that each contain one `f32` value and getting an `f32` as the result, you might add two registers that each contain `f32x4` (128 bits of data) and then you get an `f32x4` as the output.

This might seem a tiny bit weird at first, but there's a good reason for it. Back in the day, as CPUs got faster and faster, eventually they got so fast that the CPU would just melt itself. The heat management (heat sinks, fans, etc) simply couldn't keep up with how much electricity was going through the metal. Two main strategies were developed to help get around the limits of physics.
* One of them you're probably familiar with: Multi-core processors. By giving a processor more than one core, each core can do its own work, and because they're physically distant (at least on the CPU's scale) the heat can still be managed. Unfortunately, not all tasks can just be split up across cores in an efficient way.
* The second strategy is SIMD. If you can't make the register go any faster, you can still make the register *wider*. This lets you process more data at a time, which is *almost* as good as just having a faster CPU. As with multi-core programming, SIMD doesn't fit every kind of task, so you have to know when it will improve your program.

## Terms

SIMD has a few special vocabulary terms you should know:

* **Vector:** A SIMD value is called a vector. This shouldn't be confused with the `Vec<T>` type. A SIMD vector has a fixed size, known at compile time. All of the elements within the vector are of the same type. This makes vectors *similar to* arrays. One difference is that a vect
